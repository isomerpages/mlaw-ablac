Hearing of Appeal

The Registrar fixes a time and place for the hearing of the appeal and gives at least 14 days' notice to the parties. <br>

Parties attend hearing either in person or by a lawyer. See  [section 25(2)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966?ProvIds=pr25-#pr25-).  <br>

The decision of the Board shall be final except that where the award as determined by the Board (excluding the amount of any costs awarded) exceeds $5000.  The Appellant or the Collector may appeal to the Court of Appeal upon any question of law.  See [section 29(1)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966?ProvIds=pr29-#pr29-) and [section 29(2)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966?ProvIds=pr29-#pr29-).  <br>

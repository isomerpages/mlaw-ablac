**What kind of advice or information can I obtain from the Appeals Board?** <br>
The Appeals Board is an independent tribunal which hears and determines appeals against awards made by the Collector of Land Revenue concerning compulsory land acquisition. Thus, the Appeals Board is not able to and does not give legal advice to any person. You are advised to engage a lawyer if you require legal advice on whether you should lodge an appeal, the merits of your appeal, and the presentation of your case.

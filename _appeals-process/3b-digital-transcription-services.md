Where any party requires verbatim reporting services for proceedings before the Appeals Board he may apply to the Registrar for such services and must do so before the Appeal is fixed for hearing or so soon thereafter as will allow sufficient time for arrangements to be made.  See [Practice Direction No. 3 of 2001](/files/Services-DTS.pdf/).

Pre-Hearing Conference
---

The Registrar gives notice of a Pre-Hearing Conference ("PHC").  At the PHC, directions may be given and orders may be made for the further conduct of the appeal. The PHC also provides you and/or your lawyer an opportunity to discuss issues relating to the appeal with the Collector of Land Revenue, so that a settlement or agreement may be arrived at. If you intend to proceed with an appeal, the Registrar may, at a pre-hearing conference, set necessary timelines for the exchange of affidavits and documents, and to fix a hearing date for your appeal, which will be heard by the Appeals Board..

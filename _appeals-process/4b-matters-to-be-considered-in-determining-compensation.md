  <li>the damage, if any, sustained by the person interested at the time of the Collector’s taking possession of the land by reason of severing that land from his other land;</li><br>
  <li>the damage, if any, sustained by the person interested at the time of the Collector’s taking possession of the land by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting his other property, whether movable or immovable, in any other manner;</li><br>
  <li>if, in consequence of the acquisition, he is compelled to change his residence or place of business, the reasonable expenses, if any, incidental to that change; and</li><br>

(2) If the value of any other land of the person interested likely to accrue from the use to which the land acquired will be put is increased, the increase is to be set-off only against the amount of compensation that would otherwise be payable under subsection (1)(c) or (d) or both, where applicable.

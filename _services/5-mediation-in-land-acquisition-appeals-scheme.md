Mediation in Land Acquisition Appeals Scheme
---
Parties to an appeal before the Appeals Board may now refer to mediation under the Mediation in Land Acquisition Appeals Scheme by lodging a [Consent to Mediation](/files/Form-MiLAAS-Consent-25Aug09.doc.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

MiLAAS was launched on 16 February 2009 and currently is available where the Collector's award is less than $500 000 and the land affected is residential (e.g. an HDB flat).

See [Practice Direction No. 1 of 2009](/files/PracticeDirection-PD1-2009-MiLAAS-21Aug09.doc1.pdf).

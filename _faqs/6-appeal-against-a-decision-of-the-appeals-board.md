Appeal Against A Decision of the Appeals Board
---
**Does the Land Acquisition Act provide an avenue of appeal against the decision of the Appeals Board?**
<br>
Where the award as determined by the Appeals Board exceeds $5,000, the appellant or the Collector of Land Revenue may appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the Appeals Board *upon any question of law* ([section 29(2) of the Land Acquisition Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966?ProvIds=pr29-#pr29-)).

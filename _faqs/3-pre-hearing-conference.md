Pre-Hearing Conference
---
**I just received a notice informing me to attend at the Appeals Board for a pre-hearing conference.  What is the purpose of a pre-hearing conference?**
<br>
A pre-hearing conference is called by the Registrar to give directions on the conduct of your appeal.  It also provides you and/or your lawyer an opportunity to discuss issues relating to the appeal with the Collector of Land Revenue, so that a settlement or agreement may be arrived at.  If you intend to proceed with an appeal, the Registrar may, at a pre-hearing conference, set necessary timelines for the exchange of affidavits and documents, and to fix a hearing date for your appeal, which will be heard by the Appeals Board.

Withdrawal of Appeal
---
**I no longer wish to proceed with my appeal.  How do I withdraw my appeal?**
<br>
You are required to lodge a <u>Notice of Withdrawal</u> [with the Appeals Board](/files/Regulation19-Withdrawal-of-appeal.pdf/).  Your deposit may be refunded to you in full if the Collector of Land Revenue agrees to a full refund.  You will need to fill in a Direct Credit Authorisation (DCA) form to facilitate this refund.
